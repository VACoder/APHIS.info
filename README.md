APHIS_Reports
=============
Thank you for your interest in this project!

An effort to  make the USDA APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) Facilities Reports available as machine readable data feed. Applications will then make this available to consumers to help make informed decisions.

Background.
  
	The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) employs agents to investigate the facilities of its license holders. There are many varities of licensees and many facilities. There are few agents but they are committed and do the best they can with the monumental task of inspecting facilities. For instance, at last count there were 2 facility inspectors for the entire state of Kansas! The reports are stored in a database within the USDA and they are made available as image based PDF files through a search interface. This method of data access does not permit any wide spread use of the information in these reports and it also exposes, unnecessarily, sensitive PII.

Project Idea.

	This project is to create an app which which will return results based on either a USDA license number or a Customer Number.

The goal is to allow consumers the ability to check on the history of a licensee in order to determine if their animal has begun life in a facility that follows USDA guidelines. 

The data provided should protect the identity of the licensee. Birth names, physical addresses, telephone numbers should not be needed as part of this data feed. 

Work is currently being done on gaining access to this data, however it is still possible to move forward with the development of apps that can retrieve and display this data so that when it becomes available it can quickly be put to use.
